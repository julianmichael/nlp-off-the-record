This is a blog by and for NLP researchers.

Our goal is to serve as a place for thoughtful debate, advice, and synthesis of viewpoints
between researchers in our community. It can be difficult to express nuanced opinions or
advice on Twitter, but often the alternative is writing and publishing whole papers. A blog is
somewhere in between. Some researchers have personal blogs, but not everyone wants one, and they
don't provide a good place for joint-authorship pieces. This blog exists to provide such a place.

Things this blog is for include:
* Opinion or analysis pieces
* Historical retrospectives, lessons learned from previous projects
* Meta-discussion about the community
* Advice for NLP research or research life
* Anything else that will generate productive discussion

It's more for discussion starters or other things that normally happen "off the record"
rather than, for example, an author to advertise their new paper, or plain lists of cool new papers.

We encourage anyone in the community to contribute.
